It may also be considered a clustering and / or recommendation system as an ideal solution may be to identify different clusters or zones of neighbourhoods and provide a list of recommendations as to which to investigate further. Our initial requirements are that the suburb should be not too far from the central business district, perhaps something like within 20-25 kilometers. It should be two or three bedroom home and additionally, we would want the median property price to not exceed 800,000 dollars. Of course these numbers may need to be revised based on what the market and data tells us..."
